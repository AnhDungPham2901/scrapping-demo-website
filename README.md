# What is this repo for?
This repo is created a website, from this website we are going to simulate many scenarios
to test the upstream change and how we can handle the change in our scrapping pipeline
for the data input in our data platform, which is built with Fabric.

The idea of hosting this website is to experiment with the schema registry in the data ingestion 
process. We'd like to
- Make sure the data quality.
- Test the data contract concept
- How we implement the contract/monitoring with in Fabric.
